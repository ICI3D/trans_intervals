## Day 1
- Meet group 
- Briefly describe the project 

### Task
- Sketch out forward transmission process and how it might look like with a given R?
- What are the columns of interest in the linelist? 

## Day 2 
- Discuss Task
- Think about how to generate the forward transmission process

### Task
- Try to code up a simple example of the forward process
- Simple code will do the trick as long as the forward transmission process is correct
- Mentors can assist in polishing the code 

## Day 3 
- Play around with the polished code 
- Think about how to summarise the linelist

### Task 
- transform linelist to ts
- what are the different interval distributions?
- What happens when you have incomplete data (i.e. remove cells, rows, columns)
- What do people do when data are imperfect? 

## Day 4
- Add correlation
